# Big-Data-Analytics-and-Machine-Learning-with-PySpark-and-Azure
 This utilizes PySpark on Azure for efficient processing and analysis of large datasets. It includes applying Random Forest classification and optimizing performance for scalability in distributed computing environments. Focused on big data analysis and machine learning.

## Description:
This project was completed as part of an assignment for one of my MSc modules in Statistical Data Analytics. It focuses on using PySpark for processing and analyzing large datasets, with a particular emphasis on efficient data handling and optimization. The project was carried out using Azure as the cloud platform for distributed computing. It also includes the application of Random Forest classification to a dataset, where I explored the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.

Key Features:

Efficient data loading and preprocessing using PySpark on Azure
Handling and analyzing large datasets in a distributed environment
Application of Random Forest for classification and predictive analysis
Performance optimization for scalability with large datasets
This project highlights my ability to work with large-scale data in a cloud-based, distributed computing environment and to apply machine learning techniques for classification tasks.
